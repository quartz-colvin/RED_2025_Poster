(@) {#example1} This is an example. As you can see **normal** markdown *inline* ~~formatting~~ [works]{.smallcaps} `here`.

This sentence refers to <#example1>. The following example contains a gloss, notice that it's introduced with `\gll` just like in gb4e.

(@) {#example2}
    \gll C'est un gloss.
     [dem.cop]{.smallcaps} a gloss
     "This is a gloss."

(@) {#example3}
    1. {#example3sub1} Enumerations within examples are also possible.

    2. And decently intuitive. Labels not required.
